## Requirements

#### System Requirements

- Windows  
- PyCharm Recommended

#### Python Packages

- OpenCV  // Computer vision
- pydirectinput  // automation
- win32gui  // screen getting
- win32ui  
- win32.lib.win32con  
- time  // utility
- numpy  


## Instructions
- To retrain an instance of the learncraft model run `main.py`
- To test the accuracy on the test set run `load_and_test.py` and follow the input instructions  
- Use `learncraft.py` (NOT `learncraft_v1`) have the model make predictions on image(s) on your computer.
    - When asked to input the path to the image to classify you can either give the full path to the image itself (e.g `../Pictures/picture_to_classify.png`) or give it a directory if you want it to make predictions on all files in that directory (e.g `./data/train/diamond`)\*  

\*Note that it will only predict on files in that directory NOT any subdirectories


## file descriptions
- `generateData.py`: our dataset generator
- `main.py`: fits the model
- `load_and_test.py`: tests the accuracy of the model on a test set (model must be pretrained)
- `learncraft.py`: script allowing users to input images and get predictions 
- `learncraft_v1.py`, `rotation test and shape predict concept.ipynb`: residual code from attempts at using a KNN classifier rather than a neural network
- `extractFeatures.py`: helper function for `generateData.py` Not explicitly used in learncraft itself but is there as a jumping off point for using the csv files generated by `generateData.py`
